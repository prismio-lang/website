Guides connect multiple reference rules into a maintainable workflow. They assume the reader already knows the basic syntax and call out experimental or foreign-code boundaries explicitly.

## Application development

- [Organize source with modules](/guides/modules) explains entry-rooted dotted imports, wildcard imports, flattened names, and project layout.
- [Call C with ownership contracts](/guides/ffi) covers exact ABI declarations, borrow/consume/retain contracts, native linking, and wrapper design.
- [Choose memory intent with AIF](/guides/memory-and-aif) starts from stable ownership, inspects allocation evidence, and adds experimental constraints only when measured.

## Compiler development

- [Develop the self-hosted compiler](/guides/compiler-development) covers generation builds, fixed points, regression tests, AIF oracles, and cross-platform checks.

Guides are task-oriented rather than normative. Follow their links into the [language reference](/language) for syntax and the [specification](/specification) for conformance requirements. For a small copyable program, use [verified examples](/examples); for one focused integration task, use the [cookbook](/cookbook).
