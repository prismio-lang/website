`Vec<T>` is the growable, contiguous, owned sequence — the vector you reach for by default. `import std.vec` for literals and methods.

<!-- prismio-check: pass -->
```prismio
import std.io
import std.vec

fn main() -> Int {
    let scores: Vec<Int> = [70, 85]
    scores.push(92)
    scores.insert(0, 60)

    println(scores.length)      // 4
    println(scores.first)       // 60
    println(scores.last)        // 92
    println(scores.contains(85))
    return 0
}
```

The type was called `List<T>` before 0.1's collections work. That spelling is now an error that names `Vec<T>`; nothing else about the type changed.

## Build one

| Form | Gives |
|---|---|
| `let v: Vec<Int> = []` | an empty Vec |
| `let v: Vec<Int> = [1, 2, 3]` | a Vec holding those elements, up to twelve of them |
| `Vec<Int>.withCapacity(n)` | an empty Vec with room for `n` elements before it reallocates |

The element type comes from what the literal is assigned to — an annotation, a struct field, a parameter. `[1, 2]` written as a `Vec<I64>` holds `I64`s.

A literal needs its elements to implement `Copy` (every scalar, `String`, and any struct that writes the impl), because each element is duplicated into the new Vec. Past twelve elements, push them.

## Methods

`v.name(args)` is the call; properties are read without parentheses.

### Size

| Property | Answers |
|---|---|
| `v.length` | the number of elements |
| `v.isEmpty` / `v.isNotEmpty` | whether that number is zero |
| `v.capacity` | how many elements fit before the next reallocation |

### Read

| Form | Answers |
|---|---|
| `v[i]` | the element at `i` |
| `v.first` / `v.last` | the element at either end |
| `v.get(i)` | `Option.Some(element)`, or `Option.None` when `i` is outside `[0, length)` |
| `for x in v` | each element in order |
| `v[a..b]` | a [slice](/language/arrays-and-lists#slices) of the range |

**An index outside the Vec answers the element type's zero, not an error** — `0` for an `Int`, `""` for a `String`. Check `length` first, or use `get`, which says whether the element was there. `last` reads its receiver twice, so it has to be a name or a field of one; bind a call's result first.

### Search

Requires `T: Eq` (from `std.eq`, which covers every scalar and `String`).

| Method | Answers |
|---|---|
| `v.contains(x)` | whether any element equals `x` |
| `v.indexOf(x)` / `v.lastIndexOf(x)` | the first or last position holding `x`, or `-1` |
| `v.countOf(x)` | how many elements equal `x` |
| `v.binarySearch(x)` | the position of `x` in a **sorted** Vec, or `-1`; requires `T: Ord` |
| `v.isSorted()` | whether the elements are in order; requires `T: Ord` |

### Change

| Method | Does |
|---|---|
| `v.push(x)` | appends `x` |
| `v.insert(i, x)` | puts `x` at `i` and moves the rest up; `i` may be `length` |
| `v[i] = x` / `v.set(i, x)` | replaces the element at `i` |
| `v.swap(i, j)` | exchanges two elements |
| `v.pop()` | removes the last element: `Option.Some(it)`, or `Option.None` when empty |
| `v.removeAt(i)` | removes the element at `i` and returns it; everything after moves down |
| `v.truncate(n)` | keeps the first `n` elements |
| `v.clear()` | removes every element |
| `v.reserve(n)` | makes room for `n` elements in total |
| `v.extend(other)` | appends a copy of every element of `other` |
| `v.reverse()` | reverses the order in place |
| `v.sort()` / `v.sortBy(f)` | sorts in place — see [Sorting](#sorting) |

`push`, `insert` and `set` **move** the value in: the name you pushed is no longer usable. `pop`, `removeAt`, `get` and `extend` hand out copies, so they need `T: Copy`.

<!-- prismio-check: pass -->
```prismio
import std.io
import std.vec
import std.option

fn main() -> Int {
    let queue: Vec<String> = ["build", "test"]
    queue.insert(0, "fetch")
    queue.push("ship")

    let next = queue.removeAt(0)
    println(next)                  // fetch

    let finished = queue.pop()
    match (finished) {
        Option.Some(task) => { println(task) }   // ship
        Option.None => { println("nothing left") }
    }

    queue.truncate(1)
    println(queue.length)          // 1
    return 0
}
```

An `insert` or `removeAt` index outside the Vec stops the program with a message naming the index and the length. A removal that did nothing would leave you holding a copy of an element you did not take.

### Copy

| Method | Gives |
|---|---|
| `v.clone()` | a new Vec with a copy of every element; requires `T: Copy` |
| `v.filter(keep)` | a new Vec of the elements `keep` accepts; requires `T: Copy` |

## Removing an element another name still reads

`v[i]` is a view of the element, not a copy, and nothing stops the Vec losing that element while the view is still in use:

<!-- prismio-check: pass -->
```prismio
import std.io
import std.vec

fn main() -> Int {
    let words: Vec<String> = ["a long enough string to own its own memory", "b"]
    let first = words[0]
    words.clear()
    println(first)       // still the string
    return 0
}
```

This is safe. **A removed element that owns memory is released with the Vec, not at the removal**, which releases exactly what the Vec would have released had the element stayed. So a removal can never free something a view still reads. Scalars and structs with no owned fields own nothing, so removing them holds nothing back.

The cost is that a long-lived Vec which keeps removing `String`s keeps their memory until the Vec itself is released. Releasing at the removal when the compiler can prove no view exists is planned; see `COLLECTIONS.md` in the compiler repository.

## Ownership

The Vec owns its elements and is itself move-only. Pushing moves the element in, so the pushed name cannot be used again:

<!-- prismio-check: fail -->
```prismio
import std.vec

struct Item { id: Int }

fn main() -> Int {
    let items: Vec<Item> = []
    let item = Item { id: 7 }
    items.push(item)
    return item.id
}
```

A `Vec<T>` parameter borrows the Vec, so the caller still owns it afterwards. `inout` borrows it mutably, and `sink` hands the whole Vec to the callee.

<!-- prismio-check: pass -->
```prismio
import std.vec

fn total(values: Vec<Int>) -> Int {
    let mut sum = 0
    for v in values {
        sum = sum + v
    }
    return sum
}

fn main() -> Int {
    let values: Vec<Int> = [1, 2, 3]
    return total(values) - 6
}
```

**Storage follows the element type.** Scalars, `String`s and structs with no pointer-bearing fields live directly in the Vec's block; everything else is stored as one pointer per element. That choice is made when the program is compiled and changes nothing about how the Vec is used, and neither layout is a stable foreign ABI.

## Sorting

Sorting needs an order, so it needs `T: Ord` — from `std.ord`, which covers every integer type, `Char`, `Float` and `String`.

<!-- prismio-check: pass -->
```prismio
import std.io
import std.vec

fn main() -> Int {
    let xs: Vec<Int> = [5, 1, 4]
    xs.sort()
    println(xs.first)              // 1
    println(xs.binarySearch(4))    // 1
    return 0
}
```

`sort` is pattern-defeating quicksort (pdqsort) and is not stable. Ranges under 24 elements go to insertion sort. The pivot is a median of three, or of nine above 128 elements. A range that keeps splitting badly is finished by heapsort, so the worst case is O(n log n) and recursion stays O(log n) deep whatever the input.

**Ordered and repetitive input are fast, not just correct.** A Vec already in order costs about one pass, and 10 000 equal values sort in linear time.

A struct sorts once it has an `impl Ord`:

<!-- prismio-check: pass -->
```prismio
import std.io
import std.vec
import std.ord

struct Version {
    major: Int,
    minor: Int
}

impl Ord for Version {
    fn cmp(self, other: Self) -> Int {
        if (self.major != other.major) { return cmp(self.major, other.major) }
        return cmp(self.minor, other.minor)
    }
}

fn main() -> Int {
    let older = Version { major: 1, minor: 9 }
    let newer = Version { major: 2, minor: 0 }
    println(cmp(older, newer))
    return 0
}
```

**`Float`'s order is not total.** NaN compares as neither less nor greater, so `cmp` answers 0 for it. A sort over data containing NaN has an unspecified order rather than a corrupted one.

## Higher-order

With [closures](/language/closures):

| Method | Does |
|---|---|
| `v.sortBy(order)` | sorts under a comparator answering negative, zero or positive; no `Ord` needed |
| `v.filter(keep)` | a new Vec of the elements `keep` accepts; requires `T: Copy` |
| `v.mapInto(out, f)` | appends `f(x)` for every element to `out` |
| `v.countWhere(keep)` / `v.anyOf(keep)` / `v.allOf(keep)` | predicate queries |

<!-- prismio-check: pass -->
```prismio
import std.io
import std.vec

fn main() -> Int {
    let xs: Vec<Int> = [3, 9, 1]
    xs.sortBy(|a: Int, b: Int| b - a)
    println(xs.first)                              // 9

    let big = xs.filter(|v: Int| v > 2)
    println(big.length)                            // 2
    println(xs.countWhere(|v: Int| v % 2 == 1))    // 3
    return 0
}
```

**`mapInto` takes its destination rather than returning one.** A `map` that returned a `Vec<U>` would have to learn `U` from the closure's return type, and Prismio solves a type parameter from argument types only. With the destination as an argument, `U` is solvable.

## The runtime layer

The `list_*` functions (`list_new`, `list_push`, `list_len`, …) are what the methods compile to, as the `str_*` functions are under `String`. They still work, and they are not the interface this page describes.
