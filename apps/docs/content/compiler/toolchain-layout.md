A Prismio compiler is a **layout, not a file**. The executable resolves everything else relative to its own location, so the pieces have to travel together.

```text
<prefix>/
  bin/prismio                     the compiler
  lib/runtime/*.bc                LLVM bitcode merged into every program
  lib/backend.a                   linked only when building a compiler
  lib/runtime.hash                which sources those modules came from
  stdlib/*.plib                   what `import std.*` resolves to
  third_party/llvm-paths.json     which LLVM produced them
```

There is no hardcoded installation prefix and no environment variable to set. Move, rename or copy the whole directory and it keeps working; take `bin/prismio` out on its own and it can no longer build anything.

## Why the runtime is bitcode

Everything a Prismio program needs at run time — strings, lists, maps, allocation, tasks — is implemented in C and shipped as LLVM bitcode, one module per runtime translation unit, rather than as an object archive.

The reason is optimization. The driver merges that bitcode into your program's own IR **before** the optimizer runs, so LLVM sees runtime function bodies while inlining, global optimization and dead-code elimination happen. An archive would be linked afterwards, opaque, and every call across the boundary would stay a call.

Two consequences are worth knowing:

- **Your executable does not contain the whole runtime.** After the merge, runtime definitions nothing reaches are deleted. A program that never touches a map does not carry the map implementation.
- **There is no fallback.** Earlier versions could quietly compile the runtime from source when the installed artifacts were unusable, which produced a working but slower program and no indication of why. A missing or unreadable module is now an error that names the file.

## Why the standard library is `.plib`

Each standard-library module installs as one compiled artifact — `stdlib/map.plib` for `std.map`. A PLIB holds two things: the module's **interface**, which the frontend still parses, and its compiled **bitcode**, which joins the same merge as the runtime.

The interface is still source text because generics have to be instantiated against your concrete types — `Map<String, Int>` in your program cannot be pre-compiled in the library. Non-generic definitions come from the bitcode.

The directory is flattened: `std.map` lives at `stdlib/map.plib`, with no `std/` component on disk. Never derive a module's logical name from its path.

## Inside a checkout, sources win

If you are working in a Prismio checkout, `import std.string` resolves to `std/string.psm` — the source — because imports search upward from your entry file before consulting the installed toolchain. A local standard-library edit therefore takes effect on your next build with no packaging step.

Outside a checkout there is nothing to find, and the same import resolves to `stdlib/string.plib`. Both paths produce the same program; only the discovery differs.

## Reading a missing-module error

```text
ERROR: Prismio installation is incomplete or corrupted.
       Missing runtime module: lib/runtime/lang_runtime.bc
       Reinstall Prismio and try again.
```

The message names the exact file the compiler looked for, relative to the prefix. In practice it means one of three things:

- **The binary was copied out of its prefix.** Point at the original, or copy the whole directory.
- **The toolchain was never assembled.** A binary straight out of `tools/bootstrap.sh` is a compiler that can build compilers and nothing else. Run `tools/package.py` — see [Installation](/start/installation).
- **The build names a target that was not packaged.** Cross builds look under `lib/runtime/<triple>/`, and a prefix only carries the targets it was packaged for.

`prismio --version` prints the compiler and standard-library directories it resolved, which distinguishes "wrong prefix" from "incomplete prefix" immediately.
