title: Run, extend, and read the benchmark suite

The suite lives under `benchmarks/`. `benchmarks.json` is the catalog; `run.py` builds the three
dispatchers, validates results, samples workloads, and writes JSON plus an HTML rendering.

## Command surface

```bash
PRISMIO=$PWD/build/gen2 python3 benchmarks/run.py --runs 9
PRISMIO=$PWD/build/gen2 python3 benchmarks/run.py --only binary_trees --runs 15
python3 benchmarks/run.py --list
```

`--compiler` overrides `PRISMIO`. `--llvm-bin` chooses the LLVM/Clang directory. `--only` is
repeatable and `select_benchmarks()` rejects unknown names. `--skip-build` requires all three suite
executables already under `benchmarks/build`; use it only when source and compiler inputs have not
changed. `--output` changes the JSON path and the sibling HTML destination. `--open` opens the
finished report but does not alter its contents.

`build_all()` invokes the Prismio, C++, and Rust builds. `run_command()` always uses the repository
root as its working directory and captures output. Build failures include the expanded command,
stdout, and stderr. During measurement, `execute()` invokes a dispatcher, parses its two required
fields, and adds a harness-side `wall_ns`.

The loop order is run-first, language-second. This is limited interleaving: it reduces long-term
drift compared with timing every sample of one language first, but does not randomize order. For a
close result, repeat with reversed or randomized external sequencing and run A/A before assigning a
cause.

## Reading JSON

The result file records `schema_version`, `generated_at`, `runs`, `build_commands`, `compile_ns`,
`benchmarks`, and `artifacts`. Implemented benchmark records add one `languages` object per arm:

```json
{
  "elapsed_ns_median": 1234,
  "wall_ns_median": 5678,
  "elapsed_ns_samples": [1200, 1234, 1300]
}
```

`elapsed_ns_median` is the algorithm interval reported by the dispatcher. `wall_ns_median` includes
process launch and harness overhead, although raw wall samples are not currently retained. Compile
times are nanoseconds for the suite build, not per-workload compilation. Unsupported records contain
their reason and no fabricated `languages` object.

## Adding a workload

Add the catalog record, implement the same algorithm in the Prismio, C++, and Rust category modules,
wire each suite dispatcher, choose a deterministic integer checksum, and document the timed boundary.
The Prismio category files live under `benchmarks/prismio`, the C++ implementation is split across
the files in `CPP_SOURCES`, and Rust lives under `benchmarks/rust`. The string name in all three
dispatchers must exactly match the manifest `name`.

Before a long run, use `--only <name> --runs 1`. Deliberately perturb one arm's checksum and confirm
the harness rejects it; then restore it. Check that the output file fixture is used equivalently
when the workload writes data. Finally run several samples and inspect both the raw JSON and the
generated `report.html`.

If Prismio cannot express the intended standard operation, add a complete unsupported record to
`UNSUPPORTED.md`. State the missing language or library feature and why a local substitute would
invalidate comparison.

Review the generated result diff before committing. A changed checksum, build command, workload
count, unsupported reason, or sample shape is a semantic change to the evidence, not report noise.
Do not hand-edit medians: `main()` derives them with `statistics.median` from the recorded samples.
