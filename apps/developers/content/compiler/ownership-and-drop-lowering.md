Every value a Prismio program creates has to be freed exactly once — not zero times, which leaks, and not twice, which corrupts the heap. Deciding *whether* a piece of code is even allowed to free a given value is a source-level question: who owns it, has it already been moved away, is it only borrowed here. Deciding *how* that free actually happens — a stack frame unwinding, a pointer handed to `free`, a reference count ticking down — is a storage question, answered later by **AIF**, the Adaptive Inference Framework (see [AIF overview](/aif/overview)). This page is about the handoff between the two: ownership analysis decides legality, and drop lowering turns a legal program into the release calls its chosen storage needs.

Keeping these separate is what lets AIF change a value's storage mechanism between compiler versions without changing what source code is allowed to do with it.

Strings, vectors, and structs are move-only. An ordinary parameter borrows its argument for the call; `sink` consumes it; `inout` gives the caller-visible mutable access. Scalars, raw pointer values, fieldless enums, and arrays follow their own documented copy behavior instead.

## See a release happen

<!-- prismio-check: pass -->
```prismio
import std.io
import std.string

fn main() -> Int {
    let names: Vec<String>
    names.push("alpha".concat("-one"))
    names.push("beta".concat("-two"))
    println(names[1])
    return 0
}
```

Run it against the instrumented runtime, which keeps a ledger of every allocation and release:

```bash
prismio run owned.psm --verify
```

```text
Built owned
beta-two
aif-verify: 2 allocated, 2 released, 0 leaked, 0 violation(s)
aif-memory: 120 allocated bytes, 120 released bytes, 0 live bytes, 120 peak live bytes
aif-memory-sizes: <=16:0 <=32:0 <=64:2 <=128:0 <=256:0 <=512:0 <=1024:0 <=4096:0 >4096:0
aif-arena: 1 object(s), 16 byte(s), 1 region(s) on reporting thread
```

Nothing leaked. Stopping at **IR** (intermediate representation) generation (`build -o owned.ll`) shows the actual release, at the point `names` goes out of scope at the end of `main`:

```text
  %16 = load ptr, ptr %names.0, align 8
  br label %label_3

label_3:                                          ; preds = %entry
  call void @list_release(ptr %16)
  br label %label_4
```

`names` owns a `Vec<String>`, so its release kind is "list" — the compiler's internal name for the vector type — and the IR generator emitted a call to `list_release` rather than a plain free. The Vec's own element policy (releasing the two `String`s it holds) happens inside that call, not at this call site.

## What a legality violation looks like

A ledger balancing is not the same claim as a program being correct — it says releases and allocations matched counts, not that a value was read before it was freed. Ownership analysis exists to reject the mistakes that would produce a use-after-free before any of that runs. Given a struct dropped and then read again:

<!-- prismio-check: fail -->
```prismio
struct Point {
    x: Int,
    y: Int
}

fn main() -> Int {
    let p = Point { x: 1, y: 2 }
    drop(p)
    let bad = p.x
    return 0
}
```

```bash
prismio check use_after_drop.psm
```

```text
error[P4001]: use of moved value `p`
 --> use_after_drop.psm:9:15
  |
9 |     let bad = p.x
  |               ^
error: aborting due to 1 previous error
```

`drop` consumes ownership the same way an ordinary move does, so the checker treats the value as gone from that point on — there is nothing special about `drop` that a general use-after-move check does not already cover.

## A worked example: the move that ran three times

`src/sema/ownership.psm` tracks move state per binding name, over the AST in source order. That is precise for straight-line code and was, for a while, wrong inside a loop:

<!-- prismio-check: fail -->
```prismio
struct Box {
    v: Int
}

fn main() -> Int {
    let b = Box { v: 1 }
    let mut i = 0
    while (i < 3) {
        drop(b)
        i = i + 1
    }
    return 0
}
```

```bash
prismio check move_in_loop.psm
```

```text
error[P4001]: `b` is moved inside a loop, so the move would repeat on the next iteration
 --> move_in_loop.psm:9:14
  |
9 |         drop(b)
  |              ^
error: aborting due to 1 previous error
```

Textually, `drop(b)` appears once, so a checker that only asks "is this binding's single textual move legal" says yes. Dynamically, that line runs three times against a binding declared once outside the loop — a double free the source-order analysis could not see, because nothing about the *text* repeats. The fix generalizes the rule: a move of a binding that predates the loop, made from inside the loop body, is rejected regardless of how many times the source mentions it, because the loop's back-edge is a second (and third, and fourth) use the linear reading never accounted for. Branch joins have the same shape of problem in miniature — ownership state after an `if`/`else` has to be the conservative combination of both arms, not whichever arm was checked second.

## Analysis

`src/sema/ownership.psm` records initialization, moves, borrows, last use, reassignment, explicit `drop`, container transfer, and scope exit. Beyond the loop case above, it rejects use after move, dropping borrowed storage, moving the same value through incompatible paths, and ownership operations that would let a local stack-only aggregate escape its frame. A reinitialized binding starts a fresh ownership interval, distinct from the one that ended at its last move.

The semantic checker records legality only. It does not decide whether the eventual storage is stack, arena, reference-counted, or cycle-managed — AIF makes that choice afterward, without weakening any move or borrow the checker already enforced.

| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `semaBindingIsBorrow` | Classifies parameters and local bindings that observe rather than own a move-only value |
| `semaMoveOperand` | Marks the source of an ownership transfer and rejects reuse through the source binding |
| `semaConsumeOperand` | Applies consuming-call or assignment semantics to an expression |
| `semaCheckValue` | Checks an expression against the expected type and ownership context in one operation |
| `semaCheckExternContracts` | Validates `borrow`, `consume`, `alias`, `produce`, and related foreign-function-interface (FFI) annotations against the signature |
| `semaCheckUniqueArgs` | Rejects passing the same unique value into multiple consuming/unique positions in one call |

## If you are changing lowering

### Backend ownership state

`runtime/ir_symbols.c` maintains scoped binding records used while IR is emitted. `ir_mark_moved`, `ir_unmark_moved`, and `ir_is_moved` mirror the checked move state, so the backend never generates a second use or release for something sema already tracked as moved. `ir_mark_borrowed` keeps a non-owning binding out of the drop list entirely. `ir_mark_droppable(name, kind)` records the release kind for an owning slot; `ir_mark_owns_slot` distinguishes the binding that owns a slot from a temporary view of it.

`ir_scope_push` stores the current binding/drop floor. `ir_scope_drop_floor` and `ir_drop_count` expose the entries created in that scope; `ir_drop_slot`, `ir_drop_type`, and `ir_drop_kind` let `generateScopeDrops` emit releases in reverse ownership order — the same order the `list_release` call above was emitted in, just for one binding instead of many. `ir_drop_barrier_push` and `ir_loop_drop_floor` give `return`, `break`, and `continue` the correct boundary to drop back to.

### Selecting the release operation

`dropKindOf` in `types.psm`, together with AIF's own queries, choose the mechanism:

- plain owned storage calls `ir_free_object`;
- a list calls `ir_free_list`, which also handles its element policy (this is what compiled to `list_release` above);
- a `DataView` calls `ir_free_data_view`;
- an owning struct calls `ir_free_typed(value, releaseFnName(type))`;
- shared/counted storage calls `ir_free_rc` or `ir_free_rc_atomic`;
- cycle-managed storage follows its generated typed release/cycle path; and
- stack, static, borrowed, transferred, or arena-owned values emit no individual free at all.

`generateReleaseFn` creates one helper per struct whose fields require teardown. `generatedFieldRelease` asks AIF whether each field is owned, counted, cyclic, or inert and emits the matching action. `generateCyclicChildrenFn` creates the visitor the cycle collector uses.

Assignment needs a separate path, because the old value can only be released once its replacement has been evaluated safely: `generateDisplacedRelease` does that ordering. `aif_releases_on_overwrite_node` determines when a write displaces an owned value in the first place. `ir_set_reinit_target` marks a self-reinitializing accumulator so string/list operations can reuse existing storage without releasing the buffer they are about to mutate.

### Calls, temporaries, and returns

`irArgumentIsOwnedTemporary` identifies a call argument whose storage has no binding owner. `generateOwnedTemporaryRelease` schedules its release after the call completes (`ir_call_end`), except where a consuming parameter has taken ownership instead. Borrowed C-string conversion records its own call-frame temporary and releases it in `release_call_temps`.

`nodeProducesOwnedValue`, `irCallReturnsAlias`, and `aif_owns_call_result_at_node` distinguish an owned result from an alias or a view. Return lowering transfers an owned result out of the local drop set entirely; returning an alias instead extends the underlying owner's required lifetime through AIF provenance, rather than pretending the alias itself owns storage.

Ownership regressions need coverage for at least: a legal move, use-after-move rejection, borrow followed by use, consuming call, overwrite, every early exit, nested scope, loop break/continue, returned owned value, returned view, container element replacement, task transfer, an FFI contract, and both verifier and observable-value assertions — a balanced ledger and a correct answer are different claims, and a regression test that only checks the ledger can pass while returning a stale value.
