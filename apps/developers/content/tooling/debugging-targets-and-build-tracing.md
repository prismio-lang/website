Choose the inspection boundary that can still reproduce the failure.

| Question | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Does the source parse and type-check? | `prismio check` |
| What frontend structure was produced? | `prismio dump-ast` |
| Where will values live? | `prismio aif` and `--why` |
| Did runtime ownership match the plan? | `prismio build --verify` |
| Is generated IR valid? | Emit `.ll` and use LLVM verification |
| Which native build stage is slow? | `PRISMIO_BUILD_TRACE=1` |
| Do source-level debugger views match? | Build with `-g`, then use LLDB or GDB |

## Targets

`--target` and `--sysroot` control cross-target compilation when the LLVM target, SDK, linker
inputs, and runtime bitcode for that triple exist under `lib/runtime/<triple>/`. A successful IR
emission does not prove that the toolchain ships everything needed to link or run that target; a
missing module is reported by name rather than as a generic link failure.

## Failure isolation

Emit textual IR to separate frontend/codegen success from object and link configuration. The
library bitcode merge has no bypass — there is no supported build that skips it, and the obsolete
`PRISMIO_INLINE_RUNTIME` is ignored — so isolate that boundary by reading the merged module
(`-o out.ll` before the merge, `PRISMIO_BUILD_TRACE=1` for the stage timing) rather than by turning
it off. Use the exact compiler path and target triple in reports.

For memory bugs, combine value assertions, the verifier ledger, AIF explanation, and a native
sanitizer. Each observes a different class of failure.

## Target selection

`common/target.psm` owns the selected triple, data layout, pointer width, and explicit/default
state. `ir_target_select` asks LLVM to validate a triple and derive its layout.
`ir_target_triple`, `ir_target_data_layout`, `ir_target_pointer_bits`, and
`ir_target_is_explicit` expose the result. `ir_module_set_target` stamps both strings on every
generated module.

`compiler_set_sysroot` records an explicit SDK root. `target_clang_flags` converts target and
sysroot into native compiler arguments. `find_llvm_paths` resolves the LLVM installation used to
build/link backend and runtime support. Diagnose these layers separately: frontend acceptance,
IR triple/layout, object generation, runtime bitcode availability for the triple, and final link.

## Build tracing

`build_trace_enabled` reads the supported trace switch. `build_trace_ms` provides monotonic
timestamps, and `build_trace_stage(name, start)` reports the elapsed stage. Instrumented stages
include runtime discovery/curation, IR-to-object compilation, cache lookup, native runtime objects,
linking, debug-symbol output, publish, and execution.

Object-cache tracing is separate. `object_cache_trace` reports the computed key and hit/miss
decision; `object_cache_disabled` forces a real rebuild. A suspicious performance or correctness
result should be reproduced with caching disabled.

## Compiler inspection boundaries

- `prismio check` isolates lexer/parser/import/sema.
- `prismio dump-ast` exposes the resolved AST before AIF/backend.
- `prismio aif --why <site>` explains memory facts and placement.
- `prismio build file.psm -o file.ll` stops at textual LLVM IR.
- Native build tracing exposes object/runtime/link steps.
- `--verify` instruments runtime memory actions.
- ASan and TSan cover native memory/race behavior outside the verifier's model.

When filing a target failure, include `prismio --version`, host OS/architecture, requested triple,
sysroot, compiler path, runtime hashes, complete command, first failing stage, emitted IR/object
availability, and the relevant trace. “Cross compilation failed” is not enough to identify whether
LLVM, the runtime, SDK, linker, or manifest owns the problem.
